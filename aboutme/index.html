    <h2>Ellie</h2>
    <p>Hi! My name is Eliana Tatlock. My name can be hard to pronounce so you can call me Ellie.
    I am originally from Ecuador (South America). I am married and have no children yet. I lived in
    in Italy for a few years. My favorite pizza was "panna, mais, e prosciutto" which would be
    "white sauce, corn, and ham". Now I live in SoCal where there is also delicious food.
    </p>
    
    <p>This is my first semester. I am still exploring my educational options. So for now, I am hoping to get enough exposure to 
    web developing to know whether to persue a degree in Applied Technology or not. So far, I like it a lot!
    </p>
