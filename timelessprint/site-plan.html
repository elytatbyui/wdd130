      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p> 
        Fashion, we all are part of that world. 
        We do not buy clothing only for pleasure, in reality, 
        it is a need. But, should we consider more than trends 
        when shopping for new pieces to add to our closet? 
        How can we be fashionable while avoiding overconsumption 
        of fast fashion? Well, the answer is classic and ageless clothing 
        that is less likely to end up in a landfill.  
        Timeless Print curates for the comfortable and stylish staple pieces meant to 
        make you feel effortlessly beautiful. Allow us to upgrade your closet with unique, 
        stunning, and sustainable apparel that never go out of style and you will always love.

      <h3>Who we are and what we do!</h3>
      <p>
        It can be challenging nowadays to find quality clothing that is fashionable and also relevant after one season.  
        Fast fashion and “here today gone tomorrow” trends continue to become a norm in the industry, 
        which inevitably hurts our planet by creating extra waste. Timeless prints deify these trends by 
        offering sustainable fashion that will work for the consumer at any stage of their life, and that’s durable enough to pass it on.  This site caters to a specific fashion style; minimal, modest, esthetically pleasing, and feminine. Our goal is to become the primary source of one of kind fashion for women of all ages and from all backgrounds who are looking for that outfit that will magnify their beauty and can be worn at a dinner party tomorrow or a night at home ten years from now.  This site is a boutique of hand-picked designs that are “timeless” in nature and will always be in style.  We are committed to having both, our customer and our planet, in mind with every fabric and design selection.
